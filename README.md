# Note-taking-app

There are 3 main funtionalities in this app:
  - Take notes and save them
  - Display a list of all the notes available
  - Modify/Delete a note

It is written in Python and HTML. 
The main module that I am using is called Flask. It is a web-framework. I thought using the browser would be better compared to using a GUI which could probably take more time to write the code.

There will be some styling involved to make this app more appealing to users.

THANK YOU :)
